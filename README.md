Pythony python. Downloady down.

Hey dad, here's how you use this
create a file called 'files' (NO EXTENSION)
put all urls inside that file
open terminal and run:
python check.py [path-to-directory (WITH TRAILING SLASH)] [default file format]
files will download to the same directory as your "files" file. this file can be placed anywhere.


DEBUGGING
if you're getting an error about files not existing, check your trailing slash and make sure theres no space between it
check to make sure you have all the parameters on the command line
cannot handle extensions above 4 characters in length. to change this, see line marked "EXTENSION LENGTH"
